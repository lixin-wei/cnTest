        <p>In Chinese, sentences with 把 are frequently used. However, making a sentence with 把 is rather tricky for many learners of Chinese. So, let us see whether you can learn (mostly on your own) how this word works in Chinese, that is, you are the one in charge of learning the usage of this word. All you need to do is to try to answer the questions that you find. To help you, the screen will display a grammar rule for each question. So pay attention to the rule first and then answer the question. Remember that you can always refer to your Vocabulary Sheet (by clicking on the gray part on the right side of the page) if you are unfamiliar with some words.</p>
        <p>Also, in this study, I am interested in what you think about when you complete these tasks. In order to find out, I am going to ask you to think aloud as you work through the questions. What I mean by “think aloud” is that I want you to verbalize your thoughts the entire time you are working on the tasks. I would like you to talk constantly. Do not plan out what you are saying or explain what you’re saying. Just act as if you are alone in the room talking to yourself while you complete the tasks. What is most important is that you keep talking throughout and talk clearly into the microphone. You can speak in English or Chinese or a mixture of both. Just say whatever passes through your mind as you complete the tasks.</p>
