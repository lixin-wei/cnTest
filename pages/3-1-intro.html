        <p>In Chinese, sentences with 把(ba3) are frequently used. However, making a sentence with 把(ba3) is rather tricky for many learners of Chinese. So, let us see whether you can learn (mostly on your own) how this word works in Chinese, that is, you are the one in charge of learning the usage of this word. </p>
        <p>All you need to do is to try to answer the questions that you find. Here are some tips to help you better grasp the use of 把(ba3):</p>
        <p><strong>(1) Pay close attention to and think a bit deeply about the feedback that you will receive after you click on an answer. For example, some feedback involves a question for you. Thinking about the question and trying your best to solve it will help you learn how to use 把(ba3).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>(2) After getting the correct answer, read the full sentence very carefully (word-by-word) for a few times.</strong></p>
        <p>Remember that you can always refer to the Vocabulary Sheet (by clicking on the gray part on the right side of the page) if you are unfamiliar with some words.</p>
        <p>Also, in this study, I am interested in what you think about when you complete these tasks. In order to find out, I am going to ask you to “think aloud” as you work through the questions. What I mean by “think aloud” is that I want you to <strong>verbalize your thoughts the entire time you are working on the tasks.</strong> Do not plan out what you are saying or explain what you’re saying. Just say whatever passes through your mind as you complete the tasks. <strong>Act as if you are alone in the room talking to yourself while you work through the questions.</strong> What is most important is that you <strong>keep talking constantly.</strong> You can speak in English or Chinese or a mixture of both. Please speak loudly and clearly into the microphone.</p>
